# Grading assistant
Mostly an exercise in file organization, the use of classes, and using an __init__.py file.

A rubric dictionary is provided in the form of {criteria : point_value} 
to the GradingAssistant class.

grade() iterates over the rubric, printing the criteria to the console where a 
point value from can be assigned, along with an option to provide a reason why full points were not awarded.

summarize() then prints all of the criteria within the rubric, 
the score for each criteria the form of (given/total), 
the reasons associated with any missing points, 
and a final score out of the total possible points from the rubric, and as a percentage.
