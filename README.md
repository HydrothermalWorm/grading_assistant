# Grading assistant
Mostly an exercise in file organization, the use of classes and an __init__.py file.

A rubric dictionary is provided in the form of {criteria : point_value} 
and iterated over by the Grade class.
The criteria are printed to the console where a point value from 0-total_possible_points can be assigned, along with reasons when full points are not awarded.

The final output is a summary of each criteria within the rubric, the points given in the form of (given/total), the reasons associated with any missing points, and a final score.
