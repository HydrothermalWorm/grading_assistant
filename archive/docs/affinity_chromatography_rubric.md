# Guidelines

### Lab notebook pages:
    - standard curve semi-log

### Figure:
    - Descriptive legend

### Discussion:
    - elution with 25mM imidazole
        - discuss molecular weight range of proteins eluted
        - Molecular weight of the most promiment band
        - How this was determined

    - Rinse and repeat for all elutions (25mM, 250mM, 400mM)

### Conclusions/possible sources of error:
    - explain discuss if the tagged LDH was succesfully purified
    - Discuss/explain the interaction of LDH with the resin, i.e. what is occuring during the elutions

### clinical significance:
    - good reference
